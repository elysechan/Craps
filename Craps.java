/* 

COMMENTS FROM THE INSTRUCTOR:

Wow, Elyse. This is a really nice implementation of the Craps game, 
and I love that you split it up into a few different static methods:
nice work! You did a great job implementing the default response (Y/n)
feature as required by the assignment (although it wasn't clear what
the default value would be--ordinarily you capitalize the default 
value in the message to indicate that).

One nitpick: Once I've started playing the game, I (probably) don't
need to be asked if I want to see the instructions every time I play.
There are ways to fix that issue, of course.

Overall, outstanding work!

SCORE: 16/15
